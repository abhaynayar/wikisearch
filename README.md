<b>Wiki Search - An extension for Chrome</b><br><br>
<p>This is an extension for Google Chrome. It is a very simple extension which lets you search the selected text by right clicking and choosing the Wiki Search from the drop down menu. Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, the only way to experience it is by cloning this git repository to your computer and then enabling developer mode in "chrome://extensions" and then dragging the folder into the Google Chrome window.</p>
